## 🌊 Water Quality and Pollution Monitoring using Machine Learning

# 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on environmental monitoring using Machine Learning techniques. The dataset used is the Water Quality and Pollution Monitoring Dataset (Kaggle)
, which contains synthetic time-series measurements of key water quality indicators such as:

•	pH

•	Turbidity

•	Dissolved Oxygen (DO)

•	Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)

•	Nitrate levels

•	Conductivity

•	Temperature

The goal is to analyze, preprocess, and prepare the dataset for building machine learning models that can predict water quality levels and detect pollution risks.

# ⚙️ Preprocessing Steps Implemented

•	Handled missing values (median/mode imputation)

•	Converted date column for time-series analysis (if available)

•	Applied outlier treatment using IQR method

•	Scaled numeric features with StandardScaler

•	Saved the preprocessed dataset for ML

# 🚀 Next Steps (Future Work)

•	Build ML models for classification (Safe vs Polluted) and regression (predicting Water Quality Index / DO levels)

•	Evaluate models using metrics such as Accuracy, F1-score, RMSE, R²

•	Develop a dashboard (Streamlit/Flask) for real-time water quality 

•	Integrate IoT sensor data for real-world applications

# 📌 Dependencies Python 3.8+

•	pandas

•	numpy

•	matplotlib

•	seaborn

•	scikit-learn
